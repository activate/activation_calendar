This project has moved to <http://github.com/activate/ActivateHub>.

Please also be advised that the master branch in the ActivateHub repo
is based off the new_master branch in this repo, not master; master has
been out of date and deviated in ways that made it difficult to merge
back together.  Therefore, unless you have outstanding changes, it is
recommended that you perform a fresh clone of the repository.

If you have outstanding changes and are not sure how to copy them across
to the new project, push the changes to your own personal copy of this
repo on GitHub and open an issue in the new ActivateHub project to let us
know.
